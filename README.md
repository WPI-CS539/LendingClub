# 120-years-Olympic-history-athletes-and-results
Motivation:
We get the data(120 years of Olympic history: athletes and results) from the kaggle, we want to build some models which could indicate that the relationship between the attributes(country, height and so on) and the probability to get the medal. Also from the results we get, we plan to use the error matrix to evaluate the effectiveness of each model.
We are going to predict that who is more likely to be a medal winner in a event for man and woman respectively.
